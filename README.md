# PyPad
A simple cross-platform text editor in python.

## Installation
`pip3 install --upgrade git+https://github.com/jacobculley/PyPad.git`

## Configuration
User config is stored in the configuration directory for your OS

Linux: `~/.config/PyPad/config.json`

Windows: `%appdata%/PyPad/config.json`

Mac OS: `~/Library/Application\ Support/PyPad/config.json`

The `config.json` in `pypad/resources` is default config that is copied to the above locations.
Editing it will have no effect, as it is only used as a fall back if a value cannot be found in the main configuration or is entirely missing.
